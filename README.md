# Rustmon

A feature-rich, versatile colorscript printer written in Rust.

Inspired by [phoneybadger's pokemon-colorscripts](https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts).

## Performance

This is written in Rust, while the original is written in Python.  
This implementation is up to 10 times faster than the original.  
(Sixteen times the detail)  

This is the Rust implementation:
